# LTrace-SeismicSignalFiltering
Simple Seismic Signal Filtering App, built with Windows Forms (following a MVC pattern) and Accord.NET framework.

# Description
This app has only one view, where both the raw signal (which is read from a file) and the filtered signal can be seen. 
The filtered signal is the result of the raw signal being applied to a LPF (Low Pass Filter) and a HPF (High Pass Filter). The filters
can be set with different cutoff frequencies values via two text boxes or sliders.
