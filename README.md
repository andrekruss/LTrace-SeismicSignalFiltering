# LTrace-SeismicSignalFiltering
Simple Seismic Signal Filtering App, built with Windows Forms (following a MVC pattern) and Accord.NET framework.

# Description
This app has only one view, where both the raw signal and the filtered signal can be seen. 
The filtered signal is the result of the raw signal being applied to a LPF (Low Pass Filter) and a HPF (High Pass Filter). The filters
can be set with different cutoff frequencies values via two text boxes or sliders.
